Tic Tac Toe Game
Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

GOAL:
The system could be run in BOT mode to print on the screen all player's moves (with a 2 seconds timeout between each round) until someone won or the
game ends with a draw.


Done = 🌞

Guardians:
1. the initial game board should be an empty 3x3 matrix 🌞
2. negative scenario: board is not empty 🌞
3. board should be displayed like this: 🌞
    | |
   -+-+-
    | |
   -+-+-
    | |

7. player X won with a horizontal line 🌞
8. player O won with a horizontal line 🌞

Steps/Process:
1. create a board 🌞

DevOps:

- who should start the game
- can we have more than 2 players
- playing() >> if parts should be extracted to a function
